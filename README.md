# chatgpt irc bot

I like irc and didn't find any chatgpt bot so I made this pretty simple and hacky one that doesn't do much besides just working.

## Installation

Clone this repo and run `npm install`. Requires `npm >= 18`.


## Usage

Copy `cp .env.example .env`, edit it with your own data. Start the bot with:

```sh
npm start
```

Mention the bot nickname in the irc channel it shows up and it will respond.
